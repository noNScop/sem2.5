## Projects / exercises I have done during holidays after the first year of my studies.
I have also read a book "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney, I was experimenting with code in notebooks associated with the book, but nothing worth uploading. 
Yet I learned there a couple of things about multiple data analysis python libraries - mostly pandas and matplotlib. Also I have gained a better intuition on capabilities of those libraries.
